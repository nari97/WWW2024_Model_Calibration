# Using Model Calibration to Evaluate Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs

This repository contains the code for our TheWebConf'24 paper. The models can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k8SeEARwV-hJk9yIDu_2kyjNWO3RjXTY?usp=sharing

To run the code and recreate experiments:
1. Use this to generate experiments: https://github.com/nari97/AugmentedKGE/blob/master/gen_calib_exp.py
2. Use this to train calibration functions according to the previous experiments: https://github.com/nari97/AugmentedKGE/blob/master/calib_train.py
3. Use this to extract the results and get the figures: https://github.com/nari97/AugmentedKGE/blob/master/calib_extract_results.py
